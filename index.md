I'm a senior software engineer specialized in **web development** with a
strong focus on the backend and **DevOps**.

I have 10 years of experience working in a variety of environments: outsource
and product startups, remote and onsite, with international teams across
multiple timezones.

I also develop various types of open source software as a hobby, not only to
solve immediate problems and satisfy my intellectual curiosity, but also to
evaluate interesting emerging technologies.

  PostgreSQL, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, Docker Compose, React,
  AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, Ansible, Kafka, Redis, REST APIs, GitHub, GitLab,

- **Casual experience** (through hobby projects): Zig, Tcl/Tk, Tkinter, Go,
  SQLite, Flask, GitHub Actions, SourceHut, Nginx, Caddy, systemd, SDL3,
  Makefiles, pyinfra, Tailscale, cross-platform desktop GUI programming, socket
